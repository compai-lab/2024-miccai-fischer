This is the implementation from our MICCAI2024 paper "Progressive Growing of Patch Size: Resource-Efficient Curriculum Learning for Dense Prediction Tasks". Abstract. In this work, we introduce Progressive Growing of Patch
Size, a resource-efficient implicit curriculum learning approach for dense prediction tasks. Our curriculum approach is defined by growing the patch size during model training, which gradually increases the taskâ€™s difficulty. We integrated our curriculum into the nnU-Net framework and evaluated the methodology on all 10 tasks of the Medical Segmentation Decathlon. With our approach, we are able to substantially reduce runtime, computational costs, and CO2 emissions of network training compared to classical constant patch size training. In our experiments, the curriculum approach resulted in improved convergence.

# Results on Medical Segmentation Decathlon

The curriculum reduces the runtime on average by 50%, while achieving equivalent or slighty improved performance.

# Usage of PGPS Curricula with nnUNet

## Installation

If you want to use the curriculum on top of nnUNetv2, follow this instruction! The curriculum is currently only applicable with nnunetv2=2.0.0.
As the configuration manager of nnUNetv2 was changed in newer versions and is not yet compatible with this nnUnet trainer script!

Training code for PGPS/PGPSplus/RPSS can be found in directory:

- ./training/nnUNetTrainer/variants/sampling/nnUNetTrainer_PGPS.py
- ./training/nnUNetTrainer/variants/sampling/nnUNetTrainer_PGPSplus.py
- ./training/nnUNetTrainer/variants/sampling/nnUNetTrainer_RPSS.py

For using the code, please install nnUNet from https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet according to their documentation: https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet/blob/master/documentation/installation_instructions.md.
After that you need to copy the training code plus a plans handler file from THIS github repo into the python site-package nnUNetv2 installation folder. This files have to be copied into the existing nnunet repository:
- ./training/nnUNetTrainer/variants/sampling/nnUNetTrainer_PGPS.py
- ./training/nnUNetTrainer/variants/sampling/nnUNetTrainer_PGPSplus.py
- ./training/nnUNetTrainer/variants/sampling/nnUNetTrainer_RPSS.py
- ./utilities/plans_handling/plans_handler.py

## Usage

Do training as standard nnUNet as specified here: https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet/blob/master/documentation/how_to_use_nnunet.md
The only difference is to specifiy the PGPS/PGPS+/RPSS trainer:
```
# for PGPS
nnUNetv2_train DATASET_NAME_OR_ID 3d_fullres FOLD -tr nnUNetTrainer_PGPS
# for PGPS+
nnUNetv2_train DATASET_NAME_OR_ID 3d_fullres FOLD -tr nnUNetTrainer_PGPSplus
# for RPSS
nnUNetv2_train DATASET_NAME_OR_ID 3d_fullres FOLD -tr nnUNetTrainer_RPSS
```
**For the best performance-runtime tradeoff use PGPS+ curriculum**

## Tracking 
It is also possible to track the C02 emissions of the training via codecarbon. For that uncomment the related code in the trainer scripts.
